# About Folder

This folder still falls under the concept of arrays, pointers, strings and functios. I have been exposed to concept of double pointers, multi dimenesional arrays and as such am going to be writing functions that works same way as the standard functions in string.h

## Contents

* memset()
* memcpy()
* strchr()
* stsspn()
* strpbrk()
* strstr
* Function that add the diagonals of a square matrix
* Function that sets the value of a pointer to a char
